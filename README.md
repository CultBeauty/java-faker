Java Faker
==========

This is our fork of [Java Faker](https://github.com/DiUS/java-faker), but with support removed for Java 1.7 and earlier - this allowed us to add support for faking Java 8 DateTime instances.
It also includes a couple of new fake data sources (Beauty and Chemistry).

To avoid confusion, we do not publish our version of Java Faker anywhere, so if you want to use it, you need to check this repo out and build it locally.

Please refer to the upstream repo on how to actually use this library.
